# LSPP60DaysOfLearning

## I am focused on doing Computer Vision for Medical Image Processing. Data Engineering quite fascinates me too. I will be learning it side by side.  

# Any feedback and guidance will be very helpful and I heartly appreciate it.

# Day1
I had jumped into Brain Tumor Detection using MRI Scans using pretrained InceptionV3 model. The model needs a quite lot of work to be pretty impressive. It had just above 50% accuracy.

# Day2
I had tried different data augmentation techniques and hyperparameter tuning for the same project above but still seen no significant improvement in the model's performance. I am yet to learn the most important things for doing such projects. 

# Day3
I tried comparing InceptionV3 with other models such as ResNet50 and DenseNet but the accracy was still the not much good. And, I was exploring Kafka alongside. So, I learned how real-time streaming can be produced and consumed using Kafka and created a NodeJs application as usecase of Kafka.

# Day4
I thought of coming to the BrainMRI project after learning about tackling such problems. So, I dived today into Object Detection and Recognition. I have read the paper [Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/990517) which gives me fundamentals of using cascade to detect object from image. I learned about Multi Template Matching too. And, finally the most used state-of-the-art vision model for object detection, classification, and segmentation tasks, YOLOv8.
